1. What is the average number of trials it took you to find a particular pre-image based on 15 experiments where n=2?
    -  69,134 trials on average 
2. What is the average number of trials it took you to find a collision based on 15 experiments where n=2? 
    -  46,481 trials on average
3. Is it easier to find a collision or find a pre-image using brute force?
    -  Collision is easier to find when compared pre-image using brute force.  To put it concisely, a collision 
       attack is not restricted by set values (unlike pre-image), so any two values can collide.
